The soultion can be approached by breaking the task into smaller chunks. Example there are 100 floors as given into the question so we can approach this step by step. Firstly there are 100 floors if we started dropping egg from very first floor, so in worst case it will be needed 100 drops. If we divide the floors into half so there will be 50 floors, then we will drop the egg from 50th floor, if the egg breaks at 50th floor then we know that the desired floor is below 50th floor, if not its above the 50th floor. Then again we will be needed to divide that 50 floors into 2, then there will be 25 floors. Like this only we will be doing it by binary search. Through this we will be getting the idea of at which floor the egg will not break. So in this approach the worst case will be required 50 drops. IF we started dividing the floors divisible to 10 (eg. 10,20,30...) then we will drop egg at 10th divisible, then we will again get the idea at which egg wont broke. In this senario the worst case will be needed 19 drops. Like this we can get the idea how we can find that floor. Eg 7,13,26,33.... So we can tackle this question with the equation x+(x-1)+(x-2)+.....+1.
