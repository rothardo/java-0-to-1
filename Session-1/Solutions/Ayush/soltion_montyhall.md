This problem has 3 card, from one of these has car. The probability of getting car from these 3 cards is 0.33, and probability of getting goat is 0.66 (0.33+0.33). Later the host reveals a card that contant a goat. It was sure that he will be revealing the goat card only. Now we need to decide wheather to switch or stay on the card that we choose earlier among the two unrevealed card. If we look at the possibilites, if we stayed on the first unrevealed card that hold probability of 0.33, our possibilites of winning the game decreases. Whereas if we switch we will be getting the possibility of 0.66 of winning. This is because, first unrevealed card hold 0.33 probability of car, and the other two card from which one is revealed and another one is unrevealed, so combining these two cards possibitites we will be getting winning probability of 0.66 out of 1. Becauses the third card got revealed that was goat, but still that card holds 0.33 probability. Thats how if we switch we gets the winning probabilty higher than staying on the same card.
0.33+0.33+0.33=1 (if all cards are unrevealed)
card 1= 0.33
card 2+ card 3(revealed)=0.66 -> card2+0=0.66 -> Card2 = 0.66
