1:Start
2:Set the target node, start node
3:Initiaze a loop
4:Set a array for the visited path with the distance between each nodes
5:Initialize a current node, it will send each node to array that it visited
6:Keep the constraint that it doesn't repeat same path again and again (a->b->c->d, but there is another path will is a->b->d, so set constraint in such a way that it doesn't go to node c again)
7:If the current node = target node, it will stop
8:Loop will work until all possible ways are covered
9:Exit the loop
10:Calculate each paths current node travelled
11:Again another loop will be used
12:That loop will compare each path's value and will return the shortest path
13:Print the shortest path and its distance
14:End
