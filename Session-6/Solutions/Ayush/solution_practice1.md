1:Start
2:Ask user to enter the string
3:Make an array insert the string into it one by one
4:Make all the character entered into smaller case using ascii values
5:Set the left side of array 0 and the right side n-1 (n is the length of the array or string)
6:Make a loop, where it will iterate until left<right
7:Left will be incremented by 1 and Right will be decremented by -1
8:Then check, if left's element of array matches the right's element of array 
9:If yes, Print True, its a palindrome 
10:If no, Print False, its not a palindrome
11:End
