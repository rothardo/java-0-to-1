# Question 4: Calculating Monthly Salary

**Question:**  
Design a flowchart that calculates the monthly salary of an employee based on the following conditions:
1. If the employee has worked more than 40 hours in a week, overtime is paid at a rate of 1.5 times the hourly rate.
2. The regular hourly rate is $15.
3. Deduct $100 for taxes and other deductions.
4. If the employee worked less than 40 hours, no overtime is paid.

The flowchart should input the number of hours worked in a week and calculate the total salary after considering regular hours, overtime, and deductions.
